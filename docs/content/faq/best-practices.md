## AI Coding Agent Instructions

For developers using AI coding agents (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codeium, etc.), Humus provides a comprehensive instructions file that you can copy to your project repository.

**📋 [Download the instructions file](https://github.com/z5labs/humus/blob/main/instructions/humus.instructions.md)**

Copy `instructions/humus.instructions.md` to your project's `.github/` directory (or similar location) to provide your AI assistant with:

- Project structure patterns (simple, organized, production-ready)
- REST, gRPC, and Queue service patterns
- Configuration best practices
- Handler patterns and examples
- Error handling strategies
- Common pitfalls and anti-patterns
- Testing guidelines

This helps your AI coding agent generate code that follows Humus conventions and best practices.

## General Best Practices

For detailed best practices and patterns, see the [Project Structure guide]({{< ref "/getting-started/project-structure" >}}) and review the [example projects](https://github.com/z5labs/humus/tree/main/example).
